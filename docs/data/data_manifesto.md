## The Data Manifesto

We believe that the values and principles described in this document ensure that we use data effectively, efficiently, responsibly, and innovatively. Our approach through this data manifesto ensures we provide a quality strategy to serve all our stakeholders, in terms of data usage and innovation for our products, services, and increasing our competitive advantage.

### Values:
- **Value** – We determine the value of our data through our innovation and creativity.
- **Build** – We apply data to create strategic and future-facing processes, with a data center of excellence to ensure innovation quality.
- **Improve** – We ensure our processes of change driven by data remains ever-changing by placing mechanisms to continuously foster innovation.

### Principles:
As a team we aim to:
1. Use data to create insight into things decision-makers don’t know that they don’t know yet.
2. Ensure everyone can read and understand data to make informed decisions, automate processes, and use predictive models, data literacy is deeply embedded in all data processes.
3. Hold executive level support that ensures strategy is data driven and there is confidence and belief in data, data processes, and all teams involved.
4. Ensure that the chief data officer leads the team and trusts in the data and data processes to enable focusing strategies to have a competitive advantage.
5. Ensure a Center of Excellence (COE) is in place that is backed and followed across all levels, with active engagement with data transition at every level to ensure full data transformation.
6. Uphold the voice of the customer, make sure it is captured in all data products during the design process.
7. Understand the five waves of data transition: aspire, mature, industrialize, realize, and differentiate and the skills that are necessary to lead sustainable change.
8. Recognize and uphold that during the aspire and mature leaders are skilled in making hard-decisions and challenging systems in place to improve data and its usage, in the industrialize phase leaders have a strong attention to detail, integration of building processes, automation and team building, and in the last two phases: realize and differentiate, leaders can drive forward innovation, leaders are deep thinkers with creativity to provide innovative solutions and gain competitive advantages, change existing markets and create new ones.
9. Implementation of AI models are done cautiously and have a clear application that is specific and well defined, and are used to help identify new and profitable opportunities.
10. Use data both internally and externally to inform decisions, while ensuring that problems of bias and blackbox issues as complexity increases are addressed.
